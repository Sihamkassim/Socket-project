Let's Talk: Java Socket Programming 🌐

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my project showcasing client-server communication using Java. Think of it as two friends chatting – one (the server) waits, and the other (the client) starts the conversation. Simple and fun! 😊


✨ Features

Real-time chat between a server and client.
Graceful disconnection with the exit command.
Lightweight, simple, and easy to run.

How It Works

Here’s a quick example to help you picture it:

Imagine the server is like a teacher in a classroom, waiting for students to ask questions.

The client is a student who raises their hand (connects) and starts asking a question (sending a message).

The teacher (server) listens and replies.

When the student is done (types exit), they leave the classroom, and the teacher waits for the next student.
It’s as simple as that – a polite conversation between two entities! 🧑‍🏫🧑‍🎓


Getting Started

Run the server – it’s like the teacher taking their seat.

Start the client – the student enters the classroom.

Chat back and forth, and type exit to wrap it up.
